//Describe the data transfer "algorithm" runtime as
//Electronic Transfer :O(s), where s is the size of the file. this means that the time to trasfer the file increases linearly with the size of the file.
//O(log N),O(N log N),O(N),)(N2) and O(2N)
//-O(big O)big O describes an upper bound on the time
//-Ω(big omega): Ω is the equivalent concept but for lower bound.
//-θ(big theta): Θ means both O and Θ
